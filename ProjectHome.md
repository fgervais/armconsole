This project aims to create a small embedded console with a little more than the SNES power to create 2D platform games. To make game creation easier a side scroller game engine will be implemented. This same engine will be ported to PC to accelerate the development cycle of the game.

For more information on the PC version of the engine see : http://code.google.com/p/armconsoledemogame/
